# Online-Dictionary
I created an online dictionary using html, css and javascript. Where I used the free Dictionary API to fetch the meaning, synonyms and Example of the word which user type in the search field. You can also search by typing into search field and by taping on the mic icon to activate voice search in the Search Field.
